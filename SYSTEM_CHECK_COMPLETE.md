## 🎯 **OPERATIONAL STATUS**

### **✅ WORKING WITHOUT ADMIN PRIVILEGES:**
- ✅ Cryptographic functions (hashing, key management)
- ✅ Sanitization method enumeration 
- ✅ System information and status checks
- ✅ Interface detection and launcher
- ✅ CLI help and configuration options

### **⚠️ REQUIRES ADMIN FOR SECURITY:**
- ⚠️ Storage device detection (WMI access)
- ⚠️ Actual device sanitization operations
- ⚠️ Hardware security command execution

*This is correct security behavior - device access should require elevation.*

---

## 🚀 **READY FOR IMMEDIATE USE**

### **Standard Operations (No Admin Required):**
```bash
python cli_working.py --methods    # Show all 6 sanitization methods
python cli_working.py --crypto     # Test cryptographic functions
python cli_working.py --info       # System status check
python launcher.py --check         # Interface availability
```

### **Device Operations (Admin Required):**
```bash
python launcher.py --tkinter       # GUI with device detection
python cli_working.py --devices    # CLI device listing
# Run as Administrator for storage device access
```

### **Enterprise Deployment:**
```bash
python install.py                  # Automated installation
.\bootable\build-iso.bat          # Windows PE bootable
./bootable/build-iso.sh           # Linux bootable ISO
```
