## 7. Security Guarantees

### 7.1 Data Recovery Prevention

**PurgeProof provides the following security guarantees:**

1. **Cryptographic Erasure**: For encrypted storage, key destruction renders data mathematically unrecoverable
2. **Hardware Secure Erase**: Utilizes manufacturer-implemented secure erase commands that overwrite all accessible areas
3. **Multiple Overwrite Passes**: DOD-standard patterns ensure magnetic trace elimination on traditional media
4. **Entropy Verification**: Post-sanitization statistical analysis confirms random data distribution
5. **Hidden Area Detection**: Identifies and handles Host Protected Areas (HPA) and Device Configuration Overlay (DCO)

### 7.2 Verification Tools Integration

**Recovery Prevention Validated By:**
- **TestDisk**: Partition table recovery fails post-sanitization
- **PhotoRec**: File signature detection returns no recoverable data
- **Magnetic Force Microscopy**: Physical magnetic trace analysis (for critical applications)
- **Electron Microscopy**: Silicon-level data remnant detection (for classified environments)

### 7.3 Certificate Authenticity

- **RSA/ECDSA Digital Signatures**: Tamper-proof audit certificates
- **Timestamp Authentication**: Cryptographic proof of sanitization time
- **Chain of Custody**: Complete operator and system identification
- **Third-Party Validation**: Certificates verifiable by external auditors
